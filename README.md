# RPA-challenge

For the project you need install cypress.

if you want run tests you can use:
command for run cypress in headless : npx cypress run
command for run cypress with test runner : npx cypress open

In project I also used typeScript for practice. 
I added 3 files (solutions) in integration/Test folder.

secondSolutionRpaChallengeTest
